<h1></h1>

### Quick Start
1. Downloaded the boilerplate, `git clone https://github.com/cgabriel5/wa-devkit.git "project_name"`.
2. Once downloaded make sure to read [`docs/setup.md`](/docs/setup.md) to get the boilerplate setup and running.
3. Get acquainted with the used Gulp commands by checking out [`docs/commands.md`](/docs/commands.md).
4. Look over all other documentation found in the `docs/` directory.
5. Start developing! 

### Features

* Boilerplate provides the basic structure to get up and running. 
* Out of convenience, it comes bundled with [`FastClick.js`](https://labs.ft.com/fastclick/), [`FontAwesome.css`](http://fontawesome.io/), [`Normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), and [`Sanitize.css`](https://jonathantneal.github.io/sanitize.css/). 
	* Don't need them? Simply [remove](/docs/remove_library.md) what you don't need.
* Need to add [`jQuery.js`](https://jquery.com/) and [`Modernizr.js`](https://modernizr.com/)? Libraries can be easily [added](/docs/add_library.md).

### Dependencies

* Boilerplate uses [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`Gulp`](https://gulpjs.com/), [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), and [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/). *Make sure they are installed*.
